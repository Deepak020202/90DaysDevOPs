### What is Docker? 🤔

Docker is a containerization tool that helps developers package applications along with all dependencies (like code, libraries, and system tools) into a single unit called a container. This ensures that the application runs the same on any system, whether it’s a developer’s laptop, a test environment, or a production server.

### Why is Docker Important in DevOps? 🚀

🔹 Solves "It works on my machine" issue – No more compatibility problems!
🔹 Lightweight & Fast – Containers use fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.
🔹 Portability – Works on any system that has Docker installed.
🔹 Scalability – Easily deploy multiple containers across different servers.
🔹 Automation – Integrates well with CI/CD pipelines for smooth software delivery.

### Basic Docker Terminology 📖

1️⃣ Image 🖼️

A blueprint/template for creating containers. It contains everything needed to run an application (code, dependencies, and configurations).
✅ Example: An image of a Node.js application includes Node.js itself and all required dependencies.

2️⃣ Container 📦

A running instance of an image. Think of it as an isolated mini-computer that runs your application.
✅ Example: Running a Node.js container means launching the app inside a safe, isolated environment.

3️⃣ Dockerfile 📜

A script that defines how a Docker image is built. It contains step-by-step instructions.
✅ Example: A Dockerfile for a Python app will specify installing Python, copying code, and running the app.

4️⃣ Docker Hub 🌍

A public repository where Docker images are stored and shared.
✅ Example: If you need MySQL, you can pull (download) an image from Docker Hub instead of installing it manually.

5️⃣ Docker Compose 📋

A tool to run multiple containers together using a single file (docker-compose.yml).
✅ Example: Running a web app with a frontend, backend, and database in separate containers.
