## Task 1: Account Creation

1. Implement an option `-c` or `--create` that allows the script to create a new user account. The script should prompt the user to enter the new username and password.

2. Ensure that the script checks whether the username is available before creating the account. If the username already exists, display an appropriate message and exit gracefully.

3. After creating the account, display a success message with the newly created username.
