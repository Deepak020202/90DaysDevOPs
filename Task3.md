Logs are crucial in DevOps! Youâ€™ll analyze logs using the Linux_2k.log file from LogHub (GitHub Repo).

Task: Download the log file from the repository. Extract insights using commands: Use grep to find all occurrences of the word "error". Use awk to extract timestamps and log levels. Use sed to replace all IP addresses with [REDACTED] for security. Bonus: Find the most frequent log entry using awk or sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10.
