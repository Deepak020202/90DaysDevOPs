## Part 3: Password Reset

1. Implement an option `-r` or `--reset` that allows the script to reset the password of an existing user account. The script should prompt the user to enter the username and the new password.

2. Ensure that the script checks whether the username exists before attempting to reset the password. If the username does not exist, display an appropriate message and exit gracefully.

3. After resetting the password, display a success message with the username and the updated password.
