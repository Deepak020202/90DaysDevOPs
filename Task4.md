## Task 4: 
### Optimize Your Docker Image with Multi-Stage Builds

1. **Implement a Multi-Stage Docker Build:**  
   - Modify your existing `Dockerfile` to include multi-stage builds.  
   - Aim to produce a lightweight, **distroless** (or minimal) final image.
2. **Compare Image Sizes:**  
   - Build your image before and after the multi-stage build modification and compare their sizes using:
     ```bash
     docker images
     ```
3. **Document the Differences:**  
   - Explain in `solution.md` the benefits of multi-stage builds and the impact on image size.
