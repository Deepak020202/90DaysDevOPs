Task :-
Protocols and Ports for DevOps Study the most commonly used protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, DNS) and their port numbers. Create a blog, article, GitHub page, or README listing these protocols and explaining their relevance to DevOps workflows.

#Solution :-

protocols enable communication between servers, applications, and services. Let's explore the most commonly used protocols in DevOps workflows.

---
**1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**

Purpose: Used for transferring web pages and resources over the internet.

Example: Accessing a website via http://example.com. 

**2. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) üîí**

Purpose: Secure version of HTTP using SSL/TLS encryption.

Example: Accessing a secure website via https://example.com

**3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

Purpose: Transfers files between client and server.

Example: Uploading files to a remote server using an FTP client

**4. SSH (Secure Shell) üîë**

Purpose: Provides secure remote access and command execution on servers.

Example: Connecting to a remote server using ssh user@hostname

**5. DNS (Domain Name System) üåê**

Purpose: Translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses.

Example: Resolving example.com to its corresponding IP address.

**Port Numbers**
port numbers are crucial for communication between devices. They help identify specific processes or services on a device, allowing data to be sent to the correct application. Think of them as apartment numbers in a building ‚Äì they ensure that the right information reaches the right place.
