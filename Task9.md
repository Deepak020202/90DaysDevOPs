## Task 9: Analyze Your Image with Docker Scout
1. **Run Docker Scout Analysis:**  
   - Execute Docker Scout on your image to generate a detailed report of vulnerabilities and insights:
     ```bash
     docker scout cves <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0
     ```
   - Alternatively, if available, run:
     ```bash
     docker scout quickview <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0
     ```
     to get a summarized view of the imageâ€™s security posture.
   - **Optional:** Save the output to a file for further analysis:
     ```bash
     docker scout cves <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0 > scout_report.txt
     ```

2. **Review and Interpret the Report:**  
   - Carefully review the output and focus on:
     - **List of CVEs:** Identify vulnerabilities along with their severity ratings (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
     - **Affected Layers/Dependencies:** Determine which image layers or dependencies are responsible for the vulnerabilities.
     - **Suggested Remediations:** Note any recommended fixes or mitigation strategies provided by Docker Scout.
   - **Comparison Step:** If possible, compare this report with previous builds to assess improvements or regressions in your image's security posture.
   - If Docker Scout is not available in your environment, document that fact and consider using an alternative vulnerability scanner (e.g., Trivy, Clair) for a comparative analysis.

3. **Document Your Findings:**  
   - In your `solution.md`, provide a detailed summary of your analysis:
     - List the identified vulnerabilities along with their severity levels.
     - Specify which layers or dependencies contributed to these vulnerabilities.
     - Outline any actionable recommendations or remediation steps.
     - Reflect on how these insights might influence your image optimization or overall security strategy.
   - **Optional:** Include screenshots or attach the saved report file (`scout_report.txt`) as evidence of your analysis.
